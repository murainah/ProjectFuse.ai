# ProjectFuse

## Overview
ProjectFuse is an innovative application that leverages the power of OpenAI's Language Model (LLM) and the OpenAI API to generate unique project ideas for students based on their discipline and area of interest. It aims to inspire and assist students in finding exciting and relevant project topics that align with their academic pursuits.

## Features
1. **Project Idea Generation:** ProjectFuse utilizes the LLM to generate custom project ideas based on the student's discipline and area of interest. By providing input parameters such as discipline keywords and areas of interest, the application generates unique and tailored project suggestions.

2. **Discipline-based Filtering:** The application allows students to specify their discipline or field of study to narrow down the project ideas generated. This ensures that the suggestions are relevant and aligned with the student's academic pursuits.

3. **Area of Interest Specification:** Students can further refine their project ideas by specifying their areas of interest within their chosen discipline. This allows for more focused and personalized project suggestions.

4. **Inspiration and Exploration:** ProjectFuse serves as a source of inspiration by presenting students with a wide range of project ideas they may not have considered. It encourages exploration and enables students to discover new areas within their field of study.

5. **User-friendly Interface:** The application offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it easy for students to input their preferences, view generated project ideas, and explore additional details about each suggestion.
